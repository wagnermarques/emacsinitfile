#+Subtitle: yet another (emacs customization)


This is a README.org of the basic-config branch.

* About

This is an another emacs customization .el files that runs at emacs initialization[Fn:1]

We knows that customization depends a lot of what you need from emacs.

So I divided the work in branchs. 

* basic-config
  I think is the most common configuration. Basic it is a defaults sanitize

* basic-developer-config
  To edit most common developer language

* full customization

  The goal is combine features of previos configuration.
    
  My dreamed final goal is to support my own BPMS project.

  With several fantastic peace of software together like nexus, maven, eclipse and some framework the main intent is to provide a bpms plataform to develope softwares.
