emacsinitfile
=============


FZLBPMS emacs init file 
-----------------------

If you want use this init.el without fzlbpms you shound want do it
in a non intrusive way in related to your own customization.


So, start you emacs with a command like this:
>emacs -q -l $FZL_HOME/etc/emacs/sitelisp/emacsinitfile/init.el

where: ($FZL_HOME is a enviroment variable)


### Some another notes:
I preferred to install some packages by (Options - Manage Emacs
Packages) way for different reasons listed below

> magit - because its dependences



This init.el was tested within enviroments listed below:
>GNU Emacs 24.1.1 
>(i686-redhat-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.24.13)  of 2012-11-17 on buildvm-15.phx2.fedoraproject.org



The features achieve by this customization can be consulted
in the el files.
